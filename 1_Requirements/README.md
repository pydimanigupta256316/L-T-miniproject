## Requirements

## Introduction
•	In olden days people store all our important contact details in phone books and papers. This is difficult process to store all the contacts so here finds the need of phonebook. phone book system is a small developed project by using this we can store all the details of a person. In manual method if we forget any information then it is difficult to get the contact details. By this application we are trying to remove all these problems.        

•	This project was chosen because it helps me to understand the basic concepts of functions, file handling and data structure. 


## Research
The main aim of this project is to develop an “phonebook contact “application using c language. In this we can add Personal information such as name, gender, phone number, email and address are asked while adding a record into the Phonebook. These records can then be modified, listed, searched for and removed. I have used many functions in this mini project. These functions are easy to understand as their name only signifies their respective operations. 
           
## Benefits
•	It becomes easy for the user to store complete information about the contact. It is easy for the user to just search his required contact number by just typing name of the contact. It can store more contacts with two or more contact numbers.

•	In this application will have security to the login page and no one can see our contacts without proper authentication. In this project we can save our contacts, address and we can search them by name and also, we can see all them at a time.

•	Adding new records, listing them, modifying them and updating, search for contacts saved, and deleting the phonebook records are the basic functions which make up the main menu of this Phonebook application
